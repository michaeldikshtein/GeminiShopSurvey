*   **Seller Reputation:** This is crucial. Look for sellers with high ratings and positive reviews.
*   **"OEM" vs. Generic:** Prioritize listings that specify "OEM" or "Original LCD" for better quality and compatibility. Compare product photos with repair guides to verify.
*   **Quality Discrepancies:** Be aware that aftermarket screens may have differences in glass texture, color accuracy, and brightness compared to the original Apple screen.
